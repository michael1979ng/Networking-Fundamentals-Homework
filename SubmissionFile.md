Your Submission: "Its the End of the Assessment as We Know It, and I Feel Fine"
Guidelines for your Submission:

Provide the following for each phase:

List the steps and commands used to complete the tasks.
List any vulnerabilities discovered.
List any findings associated to a hacker.
Document the mitigation recommendations to protect against the discovered vulnerabilities.
Document the OSI layer where the findings were found.
Phase 1: "I'd like to Teach the World to Ping"
Determined the IP ranges to scan for Hollywood offices are 15.199.95.91 15.199.94.91 11.199.158.91 167.172.144.11 and 11.199.141.91, then ran fping against 15.199.95.91 15.199.94.91 11.199.158.91 167.172.144.11 and 11.199.141.91

Used the following commands to run fping:
fping -s 15.199.95.91 15.199.94.91 11.199.158.91 167.172.144.11 11.199.141.91
167.172.144.11 is alive
15.199.95.91 is unreachable
15.199.94.91 is unreachable
11.199.158.91 is unreachable
11.199.141.91 is unreachable

Determined a potential vulnerability that IP 167.172.144.11 is responding.

Since RockStar Corp doesn't want to respond to any requests, this is a vulnerability.
Recommend to restrict allowing ICMP echo requests against IP 167.172.144.11 to prevent successful responses from PING requests.
sudo traceroute -I 167.172.144.11
[sudo] password for sysadmin:
traceroute to 167.172.144.11 (167.172.144.11), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

Disabling ICMP can cause network issues

All servers from Hollywood office are not responding, except the 167.172.144.11/32 Hollywood Application Servers which is vulnerability as per RockStar Corp.

This occurred on the network layer as Ping uses IP addresses and IPs are used on the Network Layer number 3.
â€ƒ
Phase 2: "Some Syn for Nothin"
sudo nmap -sS 167.172.144.11/32

Port 22 is accepting connections.

This occurred on the transport layer as SYN uses TCP which is connection-oriented on the Network Layer number 4.

Phase 3: "I Feel a DNS Change Comin' On"
To login ssh jimi@167.172.144.11 -22

This occurred on the application layer as DNS runs in parallel to HTTP in the Application Layer (layer 7). DNS is in effect an application that is invoked to help out the HTTP application, and therefore does not sit "below" HTTP in the OSI stack.

Phase 4: "ShARP Dressed Man"
The file left by hacker was in the etc folder: packetcaptureinfo.txt
cat packetcaptureinfo.txt

From the Firefox web browser downloaded the file: secretlogs.pcapng file.
Opened in Wireshark.

Filtered the ARP

Looking at the ARP filters request is made for the 192.168.47.1 in line one, and response on line 4 is showing the correct MAC address 00:0c:29:0f:71:a3

On line 5 the hacker has provided another MAC address 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1 which is a spoofed MAC address to get the access.
